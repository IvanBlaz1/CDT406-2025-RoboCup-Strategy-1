\section{Method}

The server \textit{ticks} every \(0.1\) seconds, wherein one command can be sent from each of the players and the trainer. The program runs a loop in the background which sends a command from the trainer to the server continually (at each tick), requesting information about the state of the field \(S_i\) at that time step, \(i\). The field state is constituted by the position of the ball and the positions and rotations of all the players.

The teams are represented as set \(\mathcal{T} = \left\{ T_A, T_B \right\}\), where \(T_A = (\text{"Team\_A"}, P_{T_A})\) and \(T_B = (\text{"Team\_B"}, P_{T_B})\). \(P_T : \mathcal{I} \to \mathcal{P} \) is a function mapping a \textit{player number} \(i\in \mathcal{I} = \{1,2,3,4,5, 6\}\) to each player \(p \in \mathcal{P}\) in a given team. A player \(p\in \mathcal{P}\) is a vector \((\phi, f, s, c)\) where \(\phi = (x, y, \theta) \in \mathbb{R}^3\) describes the position and angle of the player; \(\mathcal{A} \ni f:\mathcal{S} \times \mathbb{R}^6 \to \mathcal{S}\) is the the player's given task from a set of possible tasks \(\mathcal{A}\); \(s \in \{\top,\bot\}\) represents the \textit{status} of \(f\), where \(\top\) means "the task is completed" and \(\bot\) means "the task is ongoing"; \(c \in \mathbb{R}^6\) is a vector representing the \textit{configuration} or \textit{parameters} of the tasks in \(\mathcal{A}\) for that player.

At each time step \(i\), a background process is executing each player's task \(\bigcup_{T\in\mathcal{T}}\left( \left\{ f_p \,\middle|\, p = P_T \right\} \right)\), which, according to the task definition and the state of the field, sends commands from those players to the server, resulting in the next state \(\mathcal{S}_{i+1} = \bigcirc f(S, c)\)
