\subsection{Reinforcement Learning}
Our experiments with reinforcement learning did not give us the results we hoped for.  
Even in basic scenarios, our agent was not able to score goals consistently.  
Training in a basic two-player setup did not show any coordinated and cooperative play between the two players.  
The players run towards the ball slowly and dribble towards the goal.  
Shooting was hard to replicate even in simplified scenarios.  

\subsection{Rule-Based System}
The best results were achieved when the blue agents utilized a Rule-Based System. This outcome can be attributed to the relative simplicity and determinism of the rule-based approach, which allowed agents to make consistent and effective decisions. When employing the Rule-Based System, the blue team consistently outperformed the hardcoded red team, winning every simulated match.
