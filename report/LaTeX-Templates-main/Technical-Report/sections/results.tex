\subsection{rcssserver}
The use of rcssserver led to achieving a basic but working simulation that was used to perform the training for the genetic algorithm.

\subsection{Reinforcement Learning}
The experiments with reinforcement learning did not give the desired results.  
Even in basic scenarios, the agent was not able to score goals consistently.  
Training in a basic two-player setup did not show any coordinated and cooperative play between the two players.  
The players run towards the ball slowly and dribble towards the goal.  
Shooting was hard to replicate even in simplified scenarios.  

\subsection{Rule-Based System}
The best results were achieved when the blue agents utilized a Rule-Based System. When employing the Rule-Based System, 
the blue team consistently outperformed the hardcoded red team, winning every simulated match.
