\section{Conclusion}

For VMAS we were able to create a custom environment made for
RoboCup SSL with working low-level skills. In that environment, we managed to train the agents to go to the
ball using reinforcement learning but unfortunately no
other training succeeded. For rcssserver, we managed to setup a working simulation environment, where we were able to create low-level skills and
coordinate them via a BT. We were able to tune these skills using
GA with positive results.
