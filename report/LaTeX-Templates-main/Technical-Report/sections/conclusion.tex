\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we have looked at two types of machine learning algorithms to be used for training virtual football-playing agents, with the end goal of applying the finalized and trained-on strategies on RoboCup SSL robots. For VMAS we were able to create a custom environment made for
RoboCup SSL with working low-level skills. In that environment, we managed to train the agents to go to the
ball using reinforcement learning but unfortunately no
other training succeeded. For rcssserver, we managed to setup a working simulation environment, where we were able to create low-level skills and
coordinate them via a BT. We were able to tune these skills using
GA with positive results.
In conclusion, GA gave the best and also most advanced results out of the two selected algorithms.
For future work it would be beneficial to implement more reliable shooting/passing mechanics and to improve the 
simulation environment as a whole. The experiment would also improve with more robust low-level skills, such as
better dribbling, shooting and passing. Additionally, creating more training scenarios with simple setups like 1 against 1,
2 against 1 and pass to nearby teammate would make training more efficient. For the reinforcement learning part, creating
an improved reward function that encourages real gameplay behaviour would probably improve the overall results.
